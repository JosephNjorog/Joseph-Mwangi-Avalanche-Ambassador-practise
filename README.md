# **Joseph Njoroge Mwangi's Avalanche Projects Repository**

Welcome to my **Avalanche Projects Repository**! This repository is a comprehensive collection of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) that I have developed and deployed on the Avalanche blockchain as part of my learning journey, practice, and contributions to the Avalanche ecosystem.

## **Purpose of the Repository**
This repository showcases my skills and experience in:
- Learning Solidity and blockchain development.
- Deploying and interacting with smart contracts on Avalanche's C-Chain.
- Exploring various use cases and project ideas ranging from beginner-level contracts to more advanced dApps.
- Building scalable, efficient, and secure blockchain-based solutions.

By documenting my journey, I aim to provide evidence of my expertise in Avalanche and contribute to the growing ecosystem by sharing resources and projects that others can learn from.

## **Repository Contents**
The repository is organized into multiple projects, categorized based on their complexity and use cases. Below is a summary of the projects included:

### **Beginner-Level Projects**
1. **Hello Avalanche**  
   A simple Solidity contract to display a greeting message. This project introduces basic Solidity syntax and contract deployment on Avalanche.
   
2. **Simple Storage**  
   A contract that allows users to store and retrieve a single integer value on the blockchain.

3. **Basic Token**  
   An ERC-20 token implementation deployed on Avalanche, showcasing the fundamentals of token development.

---

### **Intermediate-Level Projects**
4. **Multi-Signature Wallet**  
   A secure wallet contract requiring multiple approvals for transactions.
   
5. **Decentralized Voting System**  
   A voting contract that allows transparent and tamper-proof elections on the blockchain.

6. **Crowdfunding Platform**  
   A smart contract to create and manage decentralized fundraising campaigns.

---

### **Advanced-Level Projects**
7. **Decentralized NFT Marketplace**  
   A marketplace for creating, buying, and selling NFTs, fully integrated with Avalanche's blockchain.

8. **Decentralized Carbon Credit Marketplace**  
   A platform for trading carbon credits, supporting environmental sustainability initiatives.

9. **Supply Chain Management dApp**  
   A blockchain-based solution to track and verify supply chain processes.

---

### **Additional Scripts and Utilities**
- **Deployment Scripts**: Scripts to automate contract deployment using Hardhat and Avalanche's C-Chain.
- **Interaction Scripts**: Utilities for interacting with deployed contracts (e.g., minting tokens, updating storage values, etc.).
- **Environment Configurations**: Config files to connect to Avalanche's Fuji testnet and mainnet.

## **How to Use This Repository**
### **1. Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JosephNjorog/avalanche.git
   cd avalanche-projects
   ```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Each project folder contains its own `package.json` file. Navigate to a project folder and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### **3. Add Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root of each project folder with the following content:
   ```plaintext
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
   ```

### **4. Deploy Contracts**
Use Hardhat to deploy the contracts to the Avalanche Fuji testnet or mainnet:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network fuji
   ```

## **Why Avalanche?**
Avalanche is one of the fastest, most scalable, and eco-friendly blockchain platforms available today. By building on Avalanche, I am able to:
- Leverage its low transaction fees and sub-second finality.
- Access robust tooling and developer resources.
- Contribute to an ecosystem focused on decentralization and environmental sustainability.

---

## **Benefits of This Repository**
- **For Developers**: Provides a wide range of Solidity smart contracts to learn from and build upon.
- **For Recruiters**: Demonstrates my skills and dedication to blockchain development, with a focus on Avalanche.
- **For the Community**: Contributes to the open-source ecosystem with reusable code and deployment guides.

---

## **Future Plans**
This repository will be continuously updated with:
- More advanced smart contract projects.
- Real-world decentralized applications (dApps).
- Tutorials and guides for deploying and interacting with contracts on Avalanche.
